// NetworkChunkPublisherUpdate is sent by the server to change the point around which chunks are and remain
// loaded. This is useful for mini-game servers, where only one area is ever loaded, in which case the
// NetworkChunkPublisherUpdate packet can be sent in the middle of it, so that no chunks ever need to be
// additionally sent during the course of the game.
// In reality, the packet is not extraordinarily useful, and most servers just send it constantly at the
// position of the player.
// If the packet is not sent at all, no chunks will be shown to the player, regardless of where they are sent.
